With a camera in hand, I immersed myself in that dynamic world, striving to freeze unique and unrepeatable moments. Over time, this passion evolved into a deeper pursuit: telling stories. I started exploring the world, traveling to distant places, and documenting stories I believed were worth sharing. Through my lens, I discovered the power of documentary photography, a tool capable of giving voice to people, cultures, and emotions. This very passion for visual storytelling naturally led me to wedding photography. Every wedding is a unique story, filled with genuine emotions, precious details, and unforgettable moments. With years of experience, I bring a keen eye, artistic sensitivity, and dedication to capturing every detail that makes your day special. I would be honored to tell your story through my images. Letâ€™s talk and create timeless memories together. </p></div></div></div>',1)),i(a)],64))}},v=t(l,[["__scopeId","data-v-0c2196ea"]]);export{v as default};
